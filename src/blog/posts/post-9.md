TypeScript brings compile-time type safety to Gatsby projects, catching errors before runtime. When combined with Gatsby's GraphQL layer, you get end-to-end type safety.

## 🎯 Why TypeScript with Gatsby?

### Benefits:
1. **Early error detection** - Catch bugs during development
2. **Better IDE support** - Autocomplete, refactoring
3. **Self-documenting code** - Types serve as documentation
4. **Improved collaboration** - Clear interfaces between components
5. **Easier maintenance** - Understand codebase faster

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Initial Setup
```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom
